MODIFICATIONS:
- Fixed shifted keys issue in VNC with QEMU (commit aed4758)
  * Replaced key_codes dictionary with key_sequences dictionary
  * Added proper handling for shifted characters (uppercase letters, symbols)
  * Added key aliases (Ctrl for Control, Enter for Return)
  * Implemented proper key sequence handling for QEMU VNC compatibility
- Re-worked message handling with struct (commit 428c5ba)
  * Replaced int.to_bytes concatenation with struct.pack for better performance
  * Added clipboard_struct, keyboard_struct, and mouse_struct for message formatting
  * Improved message handling efficiency and readability

The modifications address QEMU VNC spec violations where QEMU passes through
key-codes verbatim rather than interpreting characters with locale awareness.
The fix assumes US locale and implicitly holds shift for shifted key symbols.
