MODIFICATIONS:
- Files have been extracted and reorganized for vendoring purposes
- Import statements have been modified to use relative imports
- Some dependencies have been removed or replaced
- Code has been adapted to work as a standalone vendor package

The vendored code includes minimal subsets of the following modules:
- RPA.core.geometry (Region, Point classes and utilities)
- RPA.Images (basic image manipulation and template matching)
- RPA.recognition.ocr (OCR functionality using pytesseract)
- RPA.recognition.templates (template matching using OpenCV)
- RPA.recognition.utils (image conversion utilities)

This vendoring was done to reduce dependencies while maintaining 
compatibility with existing code that relies on these specific modules.
