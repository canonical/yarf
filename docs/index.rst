Yet Another Robot Framework (YARF)
==================================
.. vale on

YARF is a tool built upon the `Robot Framework <https://robotframework.org/>`_
that allows developers to build complex visual test scenarios and bootstrap them
locally, and then work towards automated runs in continuous integration (CI) and
use of platforms/fixtures like Vnc and Mir with minimal effort. This reduces turnaround
times without sacrificing quality and trust in the test results.
