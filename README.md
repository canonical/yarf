**YARF** is a tool built upon the [Robot Framework]
that allows developers to build complex visual test scenarios and bootstrap them
locally, and then work towards automated runs in continuous integration (CI) and
use of platforms/fixtures like [Mir] and VNC with minimal effort.

## Basic Usage

To start YARF in interactive mode, simply run:

```shell
yarf --platform {Mir,Vnc}
```

For more specific use-cases, refer to the [YARF how-to guides][how-to].

## Run from source

Refer to the [contributing section][contribution guide] to build and run YARF from source.

## Installation

YARF is available on all major Linux distributions.

On snap-ready systems, you can install it on the command-line with:

```shell
sudo snap install yarf

# Optional: in order to allow rapidocr to increase the process niceness
snap connect yarf:process-control
```

To run YARF from source, clone the repository, navigate to the root, and run (requires the `uv` tool):

```shell
uv sync --extra develop
uv run yarf
```

## Documentation

The YARF docs provide guidance and learning material about the robot libraries,
resources, metadata, use-cases, and much more:
